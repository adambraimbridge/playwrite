		TO DO:

		The player has to pick some kind of LTV plan.

		Once they do, they'll get a summary of what they just learned.

		Maybe they'll get a score, or some gold stars.

		In version 1.1, there'll be a feedback prompt with :thumbsup: :thumbsdown:  or similar.

		Next up, we can make more little games to explore how LTV relates to 'Attribution' and 'Sensitivity'.
